# Docs Index

  For AIGC. Read less. Route first.

  ## Folders

  - `docs/common/`: global architecture and shared conventions
  - `docs/api/`: API / GraphQL adapter rules
  - `docs/worker/`: worker / queue / async-consumer rules
  - `docs/project-convention/`: project-specific conventions
  - `docs/generated/`: generated local observation docs; do not edit manually
  - `docs/frontend/`: optional frontend-facing contract notes and cross-repo alignment drafts, not backend source of truth
  - `docs/deprecated/`: historical design background only, not implementation guidance
  - `plans/`: active plans, priorities, followups and deliverables
  - Do not read `docs/human/` for implementation guidance

  ## Conflict Or Overlap Resolution

  Before applying multiple rule documents, read `docs/common/rule-precedence.rules.md` first.

  ## Global GraphQL Error Contract

  - Every GraphQL interface must follow `docs/api/graphql-error-contract-current.md`.
  - AI agents must read it before changing GraphQL adapters, guards, exception filters, auth/session flows, or frontend-facing API docs.
  - `errors[].extensions.code === 'UNAUTHENTICATED'` is the stable frontend runtime signal for auth/session failure.
  - Frontend must not depend on `extensions.errorCode` for production runtime branching; it may be hidden or omitted.

  ## Route By Task

    - `docs/common/capability-plugin.rules.md`
    - `docs/generated/capabilities-current.md` when you need the current generated capability id list
    - `docs/common/boundary-contract.rules.md` when adding dispatcher / runtime contracts

    - `plans/README.md`
    - read the current plan list inside `plans/README.md`

  - Frontend contract alignment:
    - `docs/frontend/README.md`
    - backend truth still comes from `docs/api/*.md` and `docs/common/*.rules.md`

  - Auth / session current contract:
    - `docs/api/graphql-error-contract-current.md`
    - `docs/api/auth-session-current.md`

  - Account / userInfo write current contract:
    - `docs/api/account-write-current.md`
