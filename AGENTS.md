# Agent Instructions

This is the default project context for coding agents in this repository.
Keep it short and stable: project shape, non-negotiable boundaries, and where to load deeper rules.
Detailed or fast-changing rules belong in `docs/`.

## Start Here

- Read `docs/README.md` before implementation and route to the smallest relevant rule set.
- For GraphQL error/auth/session behavior, read `docs/api/graphql-error-contract-current.md`; it applies to every GraphQL interface.
- If multiple rule documents overlap, use `docs/common/rule-precedence.rules.md`.
- Do not use `docs/human/` as implementation guidance.
- Prefer existing code patterns and current ESLint rules over examples in stale plans or comments.

## Project Snapshot

- NestJS TypeScript backend with strict layered architecture.
- Primary API is GraphQL; runtime bootstraps are split into API and Worker.
- Main layers: `adapters`, `usecases`, `modules`, `infrastructure`, `core`, `types`.
- `src/types` is the global shared contract layer for stable cross-context types.
- Shared global types must be imported through `@app-types/*`.
- Boundary contract is a layer-owned dependency boundary pattern, not a standalone layer; new boundary files use `*.contract.ts`, not `*.port.ts`.

## Non-Negotiables

- Never introduce `any`; the project uses strict TypeScript and type-aware ESLint.
- Do not hardcode configuration, secrets, URLs, tokens, or credentials. Use configuration modules.
- Preserve existing comments unless removing them is clearly part of the change.
- Use `DomainError` / existing `error_code` values from `src/core/common/errors/domain-error`; do not throw bare strings for business errors.
- Do not return ORM entities or QueryBuilder objects outside modules.
- Do not put GraphQL, HTTP, Swagger, or other adapter decorators on ORM entities.
- Register runtime GraphQL schema artifacts, enums, and scalars in `src/adapters/api/graphql/schema/`, not in DTOs or resolvers.

## Layer Ownership

- `adapters`: protocol entry only. Parse input, call usecases, map output. No business orchestration and no modules/infrastructure runtime imports.
  Type-only imports from same-domain `src/modules/<bounded-context>/<bounded-context>.types.ts` files are allowed when the detailed adapter rules allow them.
- `usecases`: business orchestration, write semantics, permissions for write flows, transactions, and cross-domain coordination.
- `modules`: same-domain reusable services, QueryServices, repository/entity encapsulation, DI assembly. No cross-domain business orchestration.
- `QueryService`: modules-layer read side only. It may read, authorize read visibility, and normalize output; it must not write and is called by usecases, not adapters.
- `infrastructure`: external systems and runtime implementations such as ORM, queues, SDKs, config, logging, Redis, email, and GraphQL runtime setup.
- `core`: pure domain models, value objects, policies, core-owned boundary contracts, stable rules, and domain errors only. No framework, SDK, I/O, configuration reads, DI, or side effects.
- `types`: stable shared contracts and enums only. No framework, GraphQL, ORM, or core imports.
- Boundary contracts belong to the layer that owns the decision requiring the capability. Infrastructure implements or adapts them.

## Dependency Direction

- Allowed high-level flow: `adapters -> usecases -> modules -> infrastructure`.
- `usecases`, `modules`, and `infrastructure` may depend on `core` and `types` within their documented limits.
- `core` may depend only on core-local code and stable framework-free contracts through `@app-types/*` when allowed by the current docs and lint rules.
- `types -> types` only.
- Business `modules` may depend on `modules/common`, but not on other business-domain modules.
- `modules/common` must not depend on business-domain modules.
- `usecases -> usecases` is allowed only for same-domain orchestration, one hop deep.
- No layer may depend on `adapters`.

## Write, Read, And Transactions

- Put create, update, and delete behavior in usecases.
- Keep module write services granular; they may accept transaction context from a usecase but must not own global transaction entrypoints.
- Start and define transactions in usecases.
- Lift cross-domain reads and writes to a usecase; do not push them down into modules or infrastructure.
- Use QueryService for read-side view normalization and write-after-read output when a stable view exists.
- Treat outbox as an architectural option, not an existing reusable component.
- `TransactionRunner` is the current usecase-owned transaction boundary contract; do not introduce parallel `TransactionPort` / `UnitOfWork` aliases.
- Business usecases call cross-capability operations through typed capability clients (`*.contract.ts` in `usecases/common/ports/`), not raw dispatcher strings; see `docs/common/capability-plugin.rules.md`.

## Type Placement

- Cross-context stable contracts and enums: `src/types`, imported as `@app-types/*`.
- Same bounded-context stable contracts shared across adapters/usecases/modules: `src/modules/<bounded-context>/<bounded-context>.types.ts`.
- Flow-local or unstable types: colocate near the usecase/module/core code that owns them.
- GraphQL DTO/Input/Args/Result classes stay in adapter GraphQL directories and must not leak downward.
- Do not import implementation files just to reuse their exported types.

## Context Routing

Use `docs/README.md` as the source of task routing. Common routes:

- Layer or dependency changes: `docs/common/*.rules.md` plus `docs/api/adapters.rules.md` when GraphQL entry code changes.
- GraphQL error/auth/session response contract: `docs/api/graphql-error-contract-current.md` plus `docs/api/adapters.rules.md`.
- Boundary contract or port/contract naming: `docs/common/boundary-contract.rules.md`.
- QueryService or shared type placement: `docs/common/queryservice.rules.md` and `docs/common/type.rules.md`.
- Worker queues or async consumers: `docs/worker/*.rules.md` and queue/audit project conventions.
- Input or time normalization: `docs/project-convention/input-*.md` or `docs/project-convention/time-*.md`.
- Current API behavior: the matching `docs/api/*-current.md`.
- In-progress design: `plans/README.md`, then the specific current plan.

## Validation

- Prefer the narrowest behavior-scoped validation.
- For architecture lint coverage and file-scoped validation commands, see `docs/common/eslint-architecture-rules.md`.
- For a specific e2e slice, prefer `npm run test:e2e:file -- <path>` when applicable.
- Use `npm run typecheck` or `npm run lint` when narrow tests are unavailable or insufficient.
- Do not broaden the change set to fix unrelated failures.
